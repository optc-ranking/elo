# OPTC Elo Ranking

An OPTC community voted tier list of all Legends in Global and Japan, split between Captains and Sailors. Units are linked to the OPTC Database at optc-db.github.io, so you can easily look up the information from the ranking list!

Unit data are stored in and accessed remotely from a Firebase real time database, meaning the ranking will update in real time.

Expect the database and new units to be added monthly.
